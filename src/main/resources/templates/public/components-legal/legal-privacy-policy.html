        </p>

        <h3>The right to object</h3>

        <p>
          You have the right to object to:
        </p>

        <ul>
          <li>
            processing of information, based on legitimate interests or the performance of a task in the public
            interest/exercise of official authority (including profiling);
          </li>
          <li>direct marketing (including profiling); and</li>
          <li>processing for purposes of scientific/historical research and statistics.</li>

          online to our mail allmylinks_support@pm.me
        </p>

        <h3>The right of access.</h3>

        <p>
          You have the right to access your personal data. The reason to access your personal data is so that you are
          aware of and can verify the lawfulness of the processing. We may verify the identity of the person making the
          request, using reasonable means. If the request is made electronically, we shall provide you with the
          information in a commonly used electronic format. You have the right to obtain:
        </p>

        <ul>
          <li>confirmation that your data is being processed;</li>
          <li>access to your personal data;</li>
          <li>and other supplementary information – this largely corresponds to the information that should be provided
            in a privacy notice.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <h3>The right to rectification</h3>

        <p>
          This means the right to have inaccurate personal data rectified, or completed if it is incomplete. Personal
          data is inaccurate if it is incorrect or misleading as to any matter of fact. In certain circumstances, we can
          refuse a request for rectification.
        </p>

        <h3>The right to erasure</h3>

        <p>
          You have the right to have your personal data erased. This is also known as the ‘right to be forgotten’. The
          right is not absolute and only applies in certain circumstances, for example:
        </p>

        <ul>
          <li>the personal data is no longer necessary for the purpose which we originally collected or processed it
            for;
          </li>
          <li>you withdraw your consent for processing personal information;</li>
          <li>we have to do it to comply with a legal obligation;</li>
          <li>we have processed the personal data to offer information society services to a child.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>The right to restrict processing</h3>

        <p>
          When processing is restricted, we can store the personal data, but not use it. You can make a request for
          restriction. This is an alternative to requesting the erasure of your data. The personal information can be
          restricted by:
        </p>

        <ul>
          <li>temporarily moving information to another processing system;</li>
          <li>making the data unavailable to users; or</li>
          <li>temporarily removing published data from a website.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>The right to data portability</h3>

        <p>
          This right means that you can obtain your personal information from us and reuse it for your own purposes – to
          move, copy or transfer personal data easily from our site to another sites or services. We shall provide the
          personal information in a structured, commonly used and machine-readable form. Machine-readable means that the
          information is structured so that software can extract specific elements of the data. This enables other
          organizations to use the data. If you want it, we may transmit the personal information directly to another
          organization (site or service) if this is technically feasible.
        </p>

        <p>
          We don’t use automated decision making (making a decision solely by automated means without any human
          involvement) or profiling (automated processing of personal data to evaluate certain things about an
          individual) systems.
        </p>

        <h3>
          What are the rules for submitting requests and considering them?
        </h3>

        <p>
          You can make the requests with regard to the rights set forth above, verbally or in writing. Requests will be
          handled within thirty (30) days. The period of compliance can be extended by a further two months where
          requests are complex or numerous. If this is the case, we shall inform you within one month of the receipt of
          the request and explain why the extension is necessary.
        </p>

        <p>Where requests are manifestly unfounded or excessive, in particular, because they are repetitive, we may
          charge a reasonable fee taking into account the administrative costs of providing the information or refuse to
          respond.</p>
        <p>If we refuse to respond to a request, we will explain the reason of that and inform you of your right to
          complain to the supervisory authority and to a judicial remedy without undue delay and at the latest within
          one month. Anyway, we shall explain our decision and inform you of your rights.</p>
        <p>The security of your personal information is important to us. We follow generally accepted standards to
          protect the personal information submitted to us, both during transmission and once it is received. If you
          have any questions about the security of your personal information, you can contact us via our mail
          allmylinks_support@pm.me</p>

        <h2>
          Withdrawal and Deletion of Personal Data
        </h2>

        <p>You can initiate the deletion of your personal data at any time by deleting your account in our system. To do
          so, go to the &quot;My Profiles&quot; section by clicking on your avatar in the upper right corner of the
          screen, and delete all displayed profiles. After the deletion of the last profile, your account, along with
          all the personal data provided, will be permanently deleted and cannot be recovered.</p>

          your identity and to link the request to your account.</p>
